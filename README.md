# Louisville Police UOF Pre-processing and EDA

The following document analyzes a use-of-force (UOF) report from the Louisville Metro Police to see how often force is used, how often itâ€™s violent in nature, how effective it is, and which officers are most at fault for justifiably (or unjustifiably) using violent force against minorities. The attached analysis report summarizes the key findings and insights from the EDA.
